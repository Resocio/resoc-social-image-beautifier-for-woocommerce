Make your product awesome and branded when they are shared on social networks.

== Description ==

Visit your favorite eCommerce site and share one of its products on Facebook: the outcome is probably average. The product is cropped, or the image is surprisingly small.

Only one site is doing it right: Amazon. When an Amazon product page is shared on social networks, the product is framed, and you can see the Amazon Prime logo along with the "stars" the product recieved through reviews.

With this plugin, your products are just perfect. Automatically.

In the background, the plugin is using the [Resoc API](https://resoc.io/) to generate images that perfectly match Facebook recommandations.

=== Key features ===

* **Cropping** Your products are framed to fit social networks requirements.
* **Brand awareness** Your logo is visible.
* **Automated** You have nothing to do. Everything is handled for you in the background.
